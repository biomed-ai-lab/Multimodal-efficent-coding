Using a computational paradigm, we demonstrate how the sensory signals from the early visual and auditory systems can be understood using "efficient" coding strategies in neuroscience. Essentially, a sensory system can be derived as a result of (neurally) appropriate efficient coding of natural inputs around us. The demonstration is available as a readily-accessible Jupyter notebook that can serve students as well as researchers in understanding the link between computer science and neuroscience. Published in the Artificial Intelligence Review journal in 2021 (link to article).
