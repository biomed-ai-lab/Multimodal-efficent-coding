Using a computational paradigm, we demonstrate how the sensory signals from the early visual and auditory systems can be understood using "efficient" coding strategies in neuroscience. Essentially, a sensory system can be derived as a result of (neurally) appropriate efficient coding of natural inputs around us. The demonstration is available as a readily-accessible Jupyter notebook that can serve students as well as researchers in understanding the link between computer science and neuroscience.
